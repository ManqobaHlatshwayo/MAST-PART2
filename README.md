ChefCast is a dynamic menu management mobile app built with React Native using the Expo framework. The app is designed for Christoffel, a private chef who requires a flexible, cross platform solution to manage and update his daily menu effortlessly. In Part 1, I focused on planning and designing the user interface, sketching wireframes, deciding on colour palettes, and mapping navigation flow. In Part 2, I transitioned from concept to code, developing a fully functional and interactive app.
Part 2 Milestones
• Implemented full React Native code, developing all screens including Splash Screen, Home/Menu Screen, Add Dish Screen, Filter Screen, and Dish Details.
• Integrated dynamic features allowing the chef to add dishes with name, description, course (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) and price.
• Improved styling and user experience using a warm, modern colour palette of gold, orange, and charcoal.
• Optimised code structure by creating reusable components for buttons and inputs, using TypeScript for type safety.
• Project setup and environment completed using Visual Studio Code and Node JS, with Expo Go for testing.
Technologies Used
• React Native (TypeScript) – App framework
• Expo SDK 54 – Development environment
• Visual Studio Code – Code editor
• Node JS and npm – Package manager
• React Navigation and Expo Router – Screen routing
